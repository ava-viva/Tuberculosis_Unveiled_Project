# Tuberculosis_Unveiled_Project



In this project we examine the possible link between TB rates and air pollution levels by analyzing data on TB incidence rates and air quality indicators, aiming to uncover any connections or associations for various counties. This project involve conducting statistical analysis, using data visualization techniques to identify any potential associations or patterns between TB incidence and air quality, and potentially exploring the impact of specific health factors on TB rates.
